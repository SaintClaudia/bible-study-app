      'In many parishes, everyone enters the same formation process regardless of where they are starting. Some participants have never been baptized, some were baptized in another Christian church, and others are Catholics who have not yet received all of their sacraments.',
      'The goal of OCIA is not simply to attend classes, but to learn about the Catholic faith, ask questions, and discern whether God is calling you into full communion with the Church.',
      'Most programs meet weekly and include teaching, discussion, prayer, and opportunities to build relationships with others on a similar journey. Programs often begin in late summer or early fall and continue through Easter, though schedules vary by parish.',

      'An annulment, sometimes called a declaration of nullity, is not the same as a civil divorce. It is a process the Church uses to better understand the circumstances surrounding a marriage and determine whether a valid marriage existed from the beginning.',
      'If an annulment is needed before receiving certain sacraments, your parish will guide you through the process. Depending on your situation, you may be asked to provide documents such as marriage records, divorce decrees, baptismal records, or other supporting information.',

      'It is at this Vigil that those preparing through OCIA are usually baptized, confirmed, and receive the Eucharist for the first time. Those already baptized make their Profession of Faith and are received into full communion.',

      'The role of a sponsor is to be a witness and a companion. They attend sessions and rites with you when possible, answer questions from their own lived experience of the faith, and serve as a living example of what it looks like to be Catholic. They are not expected to have all the answers — that is what the formation process is for.',
